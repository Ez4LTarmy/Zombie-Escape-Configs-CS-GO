# CSGO Zombie Escape Configs/Stripper Used On GhostCap Gaming Servers
Here you will find a list of EntWatch and Stripper configs for use with CSGO Zombie Escape servers. These are only our public configs and are not always 100% up to date with what we have on the main server. You are free to use these on your own server just please, make sure you also pay it forward for other server owners and set your repo public!

We are starting to update this more frequently to help the ZE community and future server owners.
